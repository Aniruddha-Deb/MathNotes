Quantum Chemistry
=================================

These are some notes that I made for quantum chemistry. It's still a work in 
progress, and I hope to finish them before the minor. 

Few things to note:

1. The level of quantum chem here may be a bit higher than the level covered 
   in class. This is ok, as these notes (or some part of them) are also intended 
   for APL100 Quantum Mechanics, which offers a more rigorous treatment of the 
   subject
2. There may be errors here, as I am no pro at quantum chem. If you do spot 
   an error, feel free to email it to me, or better still, open up a pull request
   on the `git repo <https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/MathNotes>`_ after fixing 
   the error.
3. The notes here are not made from a single reference book and as such, may 
   follow a different order and structure. If you want to go deeper, the reference
   books I used were:

   1. Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, DJ Griffiths - The classic. Teaches you
      the most, but also makes you feel extremely stupid.
   2. The Feynman lectures on Physics, Volume 3 - This opens up your mind. Makes
      for very refined reading, not a book that you'll study from but rather
      get inspired to study the subject.
   3. Atkins' Physical Chemistry - This was the book our course instructor followed
   4. Quantum Physics, HC Verma - Got this very recently. It's a great book, with
      a very shallow learning curve. My only gripe is that it's not very mathematically
      rigorous for a physics textbook (unlike Griffiths) and the exercises are 
      a cakewalk

I don't know if you'll have a good time going through these notes, but my 
probability distribution function :math:`\psi^2` says you will. Happy reading :)
